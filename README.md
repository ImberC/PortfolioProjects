This project uses data from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths.
I would have liked to overlay percentage population infected with percentage vaccinated but was not able to at this time.  I could not export entire table with BigQuery Sandbox. I tried seperating into multiple tables but could not rejoin the tables once imported to Tableau Public.
My limitations with free software were definitely a factor in my success rate for this project.
